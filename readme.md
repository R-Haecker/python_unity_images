Python Unity Images
====================

Image Data set of articulated cuboids
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
This tool can create many images with articulated cuboids in different scenes.
These images are labeled and can be reused and manipulated at specific features as for example the articulatioon or the apperence which can be changed individualy without changing other aspects of the image.
The framework and the rendering are achieved through the game engine Unity 3D which communicates with the python scripts via a TCP Socket connnection.
Unity receives parameters from the script to build up a specific scene and sends the rendered image back to python.

This repository was created in a project at the research group Computer Vision at the Heidelberg Collaboratory for Image processing.
